#     In this implementation, we first define the h1, h2, and h3 heuristic functions as before. We then define the gbfs function,
# which solves the 8-puzzle problem using greedy best-first search with a given heuristic function. We also define the get_successors function,
# which returns a list of possible moves and resulting states from the current state.

# We then define the initial and goal states,
# and solve the puzzle using each of the three heuristic functions in turn.
# For each solution, we print the path of moves that leads from the initial state to the goal state,
# as well as the number of moves required to reach the goal state.

# By comparing the number of moves required using each heuristic function,
# we can see that h2 and h3 both find the solution with 28 znd 26 moves, while h1 finds the optimal solution with 14 moves.
# This suggests that h2 and h3 are better heuristic functions for this problem than h1.
# However, it's worth noting that the results may vary depending on the specific initial and goal states used.
